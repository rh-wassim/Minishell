/*Function void rl_clear_history (void)
Clear the history list by deleting all of the entries, in the same manner 
as the History libraryâ€™s clear_history() function. This differs from clear_history 
because it frees private data Readline saves in the history list.*/

Tell the update routines that we have moved onto a new (empty) line,
usually after ouputting a newline. */

/*Function void rl_replace_line (const char *text, int clear undo)
Replace the contents of rl_line_buffer with text. The point and mark are pre-
served, if possible. If clear undo is non-zero, the undo list associated with 
the current line is cleared.*/

/*Function int rl_redisplay ()
Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current
contents of rl_line_buffer.*/

If the line has any text in it, save it on the history. */
